How do we stop hackers?

One way is with Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)  

# Web Application Firewalls

i.e. Main leading providers: Imperva, Akamai, Cloudflare

* DNS Level
* HTTP Request Level (i.e string matching)

* SQL injection, XSS, etc

* Tuning and stopping false positives is resource intensive
* There are whole careers and vendors dedicated to detecting and blocking attacks.
