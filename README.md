Hi there! If you can see this message, you've reached the repository containing the stuff I've done in this course!

You'll probably find that the most useful thing here is the [blog site for this course](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-COMP6443/), where all my notes are!

Otherwise, the `blog/static/post/tools/` and `blog/static/post/course-ctf/` directories might be useful...

> Yes, if you look inside the markdown files you'll be able to find my `COMP6443{...}` flags that are removed in the [blog](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-COMP6443/).  
***But*** these are tied to my account, so submitting them won't work for you!!! haha... _unless???_
